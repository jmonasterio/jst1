// GOALS: Improvements from Ast3

// Teleport across screen in network mode is problematic because of collions and "INTERPOLATE" mode on the NetworkTransform.
// Remote player doesn't "walk" on the server. 
// Todo: Feet collider should only stop you from hitting ground. It should collide with another player while flying.
// In orginal game, your feet would not collide with floor if you hit it fast horizontally (on a platform, so you'd schootch alonig).

// x Animated player.
// AI enempies
// x Shared ToolBox.DLL - Buggy with 
// Asset bundles
// Save game info.
// Networking support for 2-player
// x Auto-deploy to GITHUB.
// Eggs
// Multi-game. Need to have same screensize everywhere.
// Multi-game. Guy sticks to top.
// Multi-game. Extra player invisible.


// TODO:
// Why sound delayed in EDITOR
// Refactor scene controller a bit more
